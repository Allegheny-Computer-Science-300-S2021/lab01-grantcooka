## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 
## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a modern method for the research on Covid-19. NGS is essentially a series of tech that allows scientists to obtain data about the full sequence of viruses that especially include any sarrs strain (like Covid-19). An example of a tool being utilized for such a case would be the whole genome sequencing metagenomics technique (WGS).

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

## WGS works by taking direct samples of the pathogen from the environment and using a powerful software to analyze and extract information about the whole genome sequence. By doing so you are able to make relations or connections to other known pathogens. However, it is hard to directly gather samples from targeted areas. NGS is stationed in various areas throughout the world. Thus, they are able to store data about the pathogen using an online database which is open for public viewing.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

## This bioinformaitcs tool seems to be a very efficient and cost effective way of gathering data and extracting information about the whole genome sequence. This is vital in identifying the gene and comparing it to others. It is simply a necessary first step towards a solution against any pathogen.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? 

## I find that it might be possible to input data for other stains of the parent gene. Thus, this may diversify the database and might cause a wider standard deviation. It might be harder to come up with solutions with a diversified data set. This could then delay possible the dispersion of medicine or treatments. It was also never taken into account if errors ocurr (such as a false positve or negative test). 

### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

## A tool known as Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) is used to study the interactions of drugs. It generally used for the discovery of potential drugs that could combat viruses such as COVID-19. 

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 
## CADD uses algorithms to create digital repositories for studying chemical interactions. It also uses programs for making unique compounds and molecules which may lead to a potential candidate.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

## I think that this tool was necessary to develop because of the fact that it not only saves time, but it also saves money. Automated research is a valuable tool that increase productivity ten-fold. The efficiency of CADD is implied by its history through the study of multiple different pathogens indicated in the article. This bioinformatics tool should also continue to develop. An AI/ ML driven CADD system would be very useful in the future.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? 

## Many different softwares used for CADD may actually be limit the research based off of availability or price. Furthermore, it could a customized paid piece of software and not open source. This may pose a problem for private investigative research which could pose a delay towards potential medicinal candidates.
